Optionally splitcr can also be a vector which assigns each person to a certain subgroup (e.g., following an external criterion). This vector can be numeric, character or a factor.\n</li>\n<li>\nse: controls computation of standard errors in the submodels (default: TRUE)\n</li>\n<li>\nx: Object of class \"LR\". Also used for visualizing the fit of single items.\n</li>\n<li>\nbeta.subset: If \"all\", all items are plotted. Otherwise numeric subset vector can be specified.\n</li>\n<li>\ntlab: Specification of item labels: \"item\" prints the item names, \"number\" gives integers corresponding to order of the beta parameters, if \"none\" no labels are printed. \"identify\" allows for an interactive labelling. Initially no labels are printed, after clicking close to an item point the corresponding label is added. The identification process is terminated by clicking the second button and selecting 'Stop' from the menu, or from the 'Stop' menu on the graphics window. For more information and basic operation see identify.\n</li>\n<li>\nconf: for plotting confidence ellipses for the item parameters. If conf = NULL (the default) no ellipses are drawn. Otherwise, conf must be specified as a list with optional elements: gamma, is the confidence level (numeric), col and lty, color and linetype (see par), which (numeric index vector) specifying for which items ellipses are drawn (must be a subset of beta.subset), and ia, logical, if the ellipses are to be drawn interactively (cf., tlab = \"identify\" above). For details about the default behavior, if conf is specified as a an empty list, see Details and Examples below. To use conf, the LR object x has to be generated using the option se = TRUE in LRtest(). See help(MLoef) for more details.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Details</b></br>\nIf the data set contains missing values and mean or median is specified as split criterion, means or medians are calculated for each missing value subgroup and consequently used for raw score splitting.\n<br/>\nWhen using interactive selection for both labelling of single points (tlab = \"identify\" and drawing confidence ellipses at certain points (ia = TRUE) then first all plotted points are labelled and afterwards all ellipses are generated. Both identification processes can be terminated by clicking the second (right) mouse button and selecting ‘Stop’ from the menu, or from the ‘Stop’ menu on the graphics window.\n<br/>\nUsing the specification which in allows for selectively drawing ellipses for certain items only, e.g., which = 1:3 draws ellipses for items 1 to 3 (as long as they are included in beta.subset). The default is drawing ellipses for all items. The element col in the conf list can either be a single color specification such as \"blue\" or a vector with color specifications for all items. The length must be the same as the number of ellipses to be drawn. For color specification a palette can be set up using standard palettes (e.g., rainbow) or palettes from the colorspace or RColorBrewer package. An example is given below.\n<br/>\nsummary and print methods are available for objects of class LR.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Value</b><br/>\nLRtest returns an object of class LR containing:\n<br/><br/>\nLR: LR-value.\n<br/>\ndf: Degrees of freedom of the test statistic.\n<br/>\nChisq: Chi-square value with corresponding df.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Package</b></br>\neRm\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Help</b>\nhelp(LRtest, package='eRm')\n\n                "
