This is of class \"loadings\": see loadings for its print method.</br>\ncenter: the means that were subtracted.</br>\nscale: the scalings applied to each variable.</br>\nn.obs: the number of observations.</br>\nscores: if scores = TRUE, the scores of the supplied data on the principal components. These are non-null only if x was supplied, and if covmat was also supplied if it was a covariance list. For the formula method, napredict() is applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the na.action.</br>\ncall: the matched call.</br>\nna.action: If relevant.</br>\n<b>Package</b></br>\nstats</br>\n<b>Help</b></br>\nhelp(princomp, package ='stats')\n"
