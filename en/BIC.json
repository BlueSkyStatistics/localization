Note that in several common cases logLik does not return the value at the MLE: see its help page.</br>\nThe log-likelihood and hence the AIC/BIC is only defined up to an additive constant. Different constants have conventionally been used for different purposes and so extractAIC and AIC may give different values (and do for models of class \"lm\": see the help for extractAIC). Particular care is needed when comparing fits of different classes (with, for example, a comparison of a Poisson and gamma GLM being meaningless since one has a discrete response, the other continuous).</br>\nBIC is defined as AIC(object, ..., k = log(nobs(object))). This needs the number of observations to be known: the default method looks first for a \"nobs\" attribute on the return value from the logLik method, then tries the nobs generic, and if neither succeed returns BIC as NA.</br>\n<b>Value</b><br/>\nIf just one object is provided, a numeric value with the corresponding AIC (or BIC, or ..., depending on k).\nIf multiple objects are provided, a data.frame with rows corresponding to the objects and columns representing the number of parameters in the model (df) and the AIC or BIC.<br/>\n<b>Examples</b><br/>\n<code> \nlm1 <- lm(Fertility ~ . , data = swiss)</br>\nAIC(lm1)</br>\nstopifnot(all.equal(AIC(lm1),<br/>\n                    AIC(logLik(lm1))))<br/>\nBIC(lm1)</br>\nlm2 <- update(lm1, . ~ . -Examination)</br>\nAIC(lm1, lm2)</br>\nBIC(lm1, lm2)</br>\n</code> <br/>\n<b>Package</b></br>\nstats</br>\n<b>Help</b></br>\nFor detailed help click on the R icon on the top right hand side of this dialog overlay or run the following command in the R syntax editor help(BIC,package='stats')\n                "
