(This definition allows non-integer values of size.)\n            <br/>\n            An alternative parametrization (often used in ecology) is by the mean mu (see above), and size, the dispersion parameter, where prob = size/(size+mu).

This is the limiting distribution for size approaching zero, even if mu rather than prob is held constant. Notice though, that the mean of the limit distribution is 0, whatever the value of mu.\n            <br/>\n            The quantile is defined as the smallest value x such that F(x) ≥ p, where F is the distribution function.\n            <br/>\n            <br/><b>Value</b>\n            <br/>\n            dnbinom gives the density, pnbinom gives the distribution function, qnbinom gives the quantile function, and rnbinom generates random deviates.\n            <br/>\n            Invalid size or prob will result in return value NaN, with a warning.\n            <br/>\n            The length of the result is determined by n for rnbinom, and is the maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions.\n            <br/>\n            The numerical arguments other than n are recycled to the length of the result. Only the first elements of the logical arguments are used.            \n"
