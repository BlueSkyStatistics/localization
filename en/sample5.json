By default, this dialog will look for common variable names within the 2 datasets and merge on the full set of common variables.<br/> If you would like to merge on a specific set of variables, you can specify those in the Advanced menu.<br/>\n            inner_join: return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.</br>\n            left_join: return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.</br>\n            right_join: return all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.</br>\n            full_join: return all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.</br>\n            <b>Usage</b>\n            <br/>\n            <code> \n            left_join(x, y, by = c(NULL), suffix = c(\".x\", \".y\"), ...)\n            right_join ( x , y , by = c( NULL ), suffix=c('.x','.y') )\n            inner_join ( x , y , by = c( NULL ), suffix=c('.x','.y') )\n            full_join ( x , y , by = c( NULL ), suffix=c('.x','.y') )\n            </code> <br/>\n            <b>Arguments</b><br/>\n            <ul>\n            <li>\n            x: dataset to join\n            </li>\n            <li>\n            y: dataset to join\n            </li>\n            <li>\n            by: a character vector of variables to join by. If NULL, the default, *_join() will do a natural join, using all variables with common names across the two tables. A message lists the variables so that you can check they're right (to suppress the message, simply explicitly list the variables that you want to join). To join by different variables on x and y use a named vector. For example, by = c(\"a\" = \"b\") will match x.a to y.b.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n            suffix: If there are non-joined duplicate variables in x and y, these suffixes will be added to the output to disambiguate them. Should be a character vector of length 2.\n            </li>\n            </ul>\n            <b>Value</b><br/>\n            A tibble.<br/>\n            <b>Package</b></br>\n            dplyr</br>\n            <b>Help</b></br>\n            For detailed help click on the R icon on the top right hand side of this dialog overlay or run the following command help(left_join, package=\"dplyr\") by creating a R code chunk by clicking + in the output window\n"
