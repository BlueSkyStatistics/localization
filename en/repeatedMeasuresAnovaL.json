Mandatory\n</li>\n<li>\ndv: character vector (of length 1) indicating the column containing the dependent variable in data.\n</li>\n<li>\nbetween: character vector indicating the between-subject(s) factor(s)/column(s) in data. Default is NULL indicating no between-subjects factors.\n</li>\n<li>\nwithin: character vector indicating the within-subject(s)(or repeated-measures) factor(s)/column(s) in data. Default is NULL indicating no within-subjects factors.\n</li>\n<li>\ncovariate: character vector indicating the between-subject(s) covariate(s) (i.e., column(s)) in data. Default is NULL indicating no covariates.

Per default, an S3 object of class \"afex_aov\" is returned containing the following slots:<br/>\n\"anova_table\": An ANOVA table of class c(\"anova\", \"data.frame\").<br/>\n\"aov\": aov object returned from aov (should not be used to evaluate significance of effects, but can be passed to emmeans for post-hoc tests).<br/>\n\"Anova\": object returned from Anova, an object of class \"Anova.mlm\" (if within-subjects factors are present) or of class c(\"anova\", \"data.frame\").<br/>\n\"lm\": the object fitted with lm and passed to Anova (i.e., an object of class \"lm\" or \"mlm\"). Also returned if return = \"lm\".<br/>\n\"data\": a list containing: (1) long (the possibly aggregated data in long format used for aov), wide (the data used to fit the lm object), and idata (if within-subject factors are present, the idata argument passed to car::Anova). Also returned if return = \"data\".<br/>\n<b>Package</b></br>\nafex</br>\n<b>Help</b></br>\nhelp(aov_ez, package ='afex')\nClick the R Help button to get detailed R help.
