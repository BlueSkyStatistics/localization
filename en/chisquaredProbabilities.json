The mean and variance are n and 2n.\n            <br/>\n            The non-central chi-squared distribution with df= n degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter ncp = λ has density\n            <br/>\n            <code>f(x) = exp(-λ/2) SUM_{r=0}^∞ ((λ/2)^r / r!) dchisq(x, df + 2r)</code>\n            <br/>\n            for x ≥ 0. For integer n, this is the distribution of the sum of squares of n normals each with variance one, λ being the sum of squares of the normal means; further, \n            <br/>\n             <code>E(X) = n + λ, Var(X) = 2(n + 2*λ), and E((X - E(X))^3) = 8(n + 3*λ).</code>\n             <br/>\n            Note that the degrees of freedom df= n, can be non-integer, and also n = 0 which is relevant for non-centrality λ > 0, see Johnson et al (1995, chapter 29). In that (noncentral, zero df) case, the distribution is a mixture of a point mass at x = 0 (of size pchisq(0, df=0, ncp=ncp)) and a continuous part, and dchisq() is not a density with respect to that mixture measure but rather the limit of the density for df -> 0.\n            <br/>\n            Note that ncp values larger than about 1e5 may give inaccurate results with many warnings for pchisq and qchisq.\n            <br/>\n            <br/><b>Value</b>\n            <br/>\n            dchisq gives the density, pchisq gives the distribution function, qchisq gives the quantile function, and rchisq generates random deviates.\n            <br/>\n            Invalid arguments will result in return value NaN, with a warning.\n            <br/>\n            The length of the result is determined by n for rchisq, and is the maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions.\n            <br/>\n            The numerical arguments other than n are recycled to the length of the result. Only the first elements of the logical arguments are used.\n            <br/>\n            <br/><b>Note</b>\n            <br/>\n            Supplying ncp = 0 uses the algorithm for the non-central distribution, which is not the same algorithm used if ncp is omitted. This is to give consistent behaviour in extreme cases with values of ncp very near zero.\n            <br/>\n            The code for non-zero ncp is principally intended to be used for moderate values of ncp: it will not be highly accurate, especially in the tails, for large values.            \n"
