When a color is set to a factor variable, the points are grouped by color and a separate line is generated for each color group.Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable. You can also optionally specify themes, and specify a title and labels for the x and y axis​</br>\n            Stair step plot: A line chart plots a line through points defined by the x and y coordinates and creates a stair step plot, highlighting exactly when changes occur. When a color is set to a factor variable, the points are grouped by color and a separate line is generated for each color group. Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable.
