        "body": "\nThis is used to specify one or more factor levels that you want to place first or last in the sort order.  This can be useful for models, \nas the first factor level becomes the reference group for parameter estimates when using reference cell coding.  They can also be useful in \nplotting as the sort order is used to display the categories.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Factor to Reorder:</b> factor you want re-ordered\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Specify Factor Levels to Move (with quotes): </b> These are the factor levels you want to reorder.  \nOnly existing levels will be reordered.  If you specify a non-existent level, a warning will be output, but any existing levels will be ordered in the \nway you specified.  View the levels in the Variables tab of the data grid to see the current levels and sort order or go to Variables > Factor Levels > Display.  \nNote that specifying all existing factor levels will reorder all levels, regardless of whether you select \"First\" or \"Last\" for level placement.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Where to place levels:</b> Selecting \"First\" will place the specified levels first in the sort order.  Selecting \"Last\" will place the specified \nlevels last in the sort order.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Create new or overwrite existing variable:</b> Controls whether you want to create a new variable with a new name or overwrite the existing variable. The \nnew variable name cannot contain special characters like #, $, %, &, (, ), =, etc.  Underscores, \"_\", are allowed.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Examples:</b>  Assume you have a four level factor with labels \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" with a sort order of \"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\" (first to last). Specifying \"d\" as \nfirst in the sort order would create a factor with a sort order of \"d\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\".   Specifying \"b\", \"a\" as last in the sort order would create a factor \nwith a sort order of \"c\",\"d\",\"b\",\"a\".  Specifying \"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"a\" (i.e. all levels) would create a factor with a sort order of \"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"a\".\n<br/><br/>  \n<b>Required R Packages:</b> dplyr, forcats\n\t\t\t"
