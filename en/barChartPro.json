        "body": "A bar chart or bar graph is a chart that presents grouped data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. The bars can be grouped by an optional factor variable. The groups can be stacked on a single bar or displayed side by side. Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable. You can also optionally specify themes, and specify a title and labels for the x and y axis.\n        You can create a barplot for a single factor variable, the bars will represent the counts of each level of the factor level. Here the factor variable will be on the x axis, see example below. When the relative frequencies checkbox is selected, we show relative frequency instead of counts on the y axis.\n        <br />\n        <code> \n         ggplot(data=Dataset2,aes(x =year)) +\n         geom_bar( position =\"stack\",alpha=0.4) +\n         labs(x =\"year\",y =\"Count\",title= \"Bar plot for X axis: year,Y axis: Count\")\n        </code>\n        <br />\n        You can create a barplot by placing a scale/numeric variable on the y axis,  and filling the bars by a factor variable. The bar will be filled by summing the values of the y variable for each  level of the factor variable, see example below\n        <br />\n        <code> \n        ggplot(data=Dataset2,aes(x ='',y=weight,fill=origin)) +\n         geom_bar( position =\"stack\",alpha=0.4,stat=\"identity\") +\n         labs(y =\"weight\",fill =\"origin\",title= \"Bar plot for X axis:,Y axis: weight,Fill: origin\")\n        </code>\n        <br />\n        You can specify a x variable, y variable and fill. The bar is filled by the sum of the values of the y variable for each level of the x variable, group by the level of the variable specified in the fill.\n        When you specify multiple x variables, we create a separate bar graph for each x variable. \n        <br />\n        Usage:\n        ​<br />\n        <code> \n        ggplot(data = Dataset5,aes(x = origin,fill = cylinder)) +geom_bar(position = \"stack\", alpha=1)   + labs(x = \"origin\",y = \"Count\",fill = \"cylinder\")  +theme_calc()+facet_grid(year~.)​\n        ​ggplot(data = Dataset5,aes(x = origin)) +geom_bar(position = \"stack\")​\n        </code>\n        <br />\n        <ul>\n        <li>\n        data: The default dataset​\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        aes():    Generate aesthetic mappings that describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of geoms.​\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        x: A factor/categorical variable.

Less conservative corrections are also included by Holm (1979) (\"holm\"), Hochberg (1988) (\"hochberg\"), \n\t\tHommel (1988) (\"hommel\"), Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) (\"BH\" or its alias \"fdr\"), and Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) (\"BY\"), \n\t\trespectively. A pass-through option (\"none\") is also included. The set of methods are contained in the p.adjust.methods vector \n\t\tfor the benefit of methods that need to have the method as an option and pass it on to p.adjust.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tThe first four methods are designed to give strong control of the family-wise error rate. There seems no reason to use the \n\t\tunmodified Bonferroni correction because it is dominated by Holm's method, which is also valid under arbitrary assumptions.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tHochberg's and Hommel's methods are valid when the hypothesis tests are independent or when they are non-negatively associated \n\t\t(Sarkar, 1998; Sarkar and Chang, 1997). Hommel's method is more powerful than Hochberg's, but the difference is usually small \n\t\tand the Hochberg p-values are faster to compute.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tThe \"BH\" (aka \"fdr\") and \"BY\" methods of Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli control the false discovery rate, the expected \n\t\tproportion of false discoveries amongst the rejected hypotheses. The false discovery rate is a less stringent condition than \n\t\tthe family-wise error rate, so these methods are more powerful than the others.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tSee also \n\t\t<br/>\n\t\thelp(geom_pwc, package=ggpubr)\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\thelp(ggadjust_pvalue, package=ggpubr)\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n        Package: ggplot2,ggthemes​\n        <br />\n        Other: Click the R Help button to get detailed R help.
