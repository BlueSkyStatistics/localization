This is commonly used to compare values between two observers or a new assay to a gold standard assay.​</br>\nThis plot may also be known as a Tukey mean-difference plot.​</br>\nObserver 1 Value: Specify the variable containing the numeric value as scored by observer 1.​</br>\nObserver 2 Value: Specify the variable containing the numeric value as scored by observer 2.​</br>\nStandard Deviation Width: Specify how many standard deviations from the mean difference reference you would like reference lines drawn.</br>\nAdditional plotting options can be modified using the Plot Options menu. </br>\nA table of the values for each of the lines are included with the figure in the output.</br>\nWe use bland.altman.stats function within the BlandAltmanLeh package to calculate differences and mean values for the chosen varianles and ggplot function withing the ggplot2 package to create this plot</br>\n<b>Package</b></br>\nBlandAltmanLeh;ggplot2;ggthemes</br>\n<b>Help</b></br>\nFor detailed help click on the R icon on the top right hand side of this dialog overlay or run the following command help(bland.altman.stats, package=\"BlandAltmanLeh\") by creating a R code chunk by clicking + in the output window\n                "
