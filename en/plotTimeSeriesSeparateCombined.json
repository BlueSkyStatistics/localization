When combined multiple variables are plotted together, when separate each variable is plotted independently. BSkyPlotSeriesWithCorrelations is a wrapper function that creates a time series object and internally calls plot.ts. \n<br/>\n<b>Usage</b>\n<br/>\n<code> \nBSkyPlotTimeSeries(vars, start, frequency, plot.type=\"multiple\", naturalLogYaxis =TRUE, main ='title', ylab='y axis label', dataset=\"Dataset1\")\n</code> <br/>\n<b>Arguments</b><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>\nvars: selected variables to plot\n</li>\n<li>\nstart: Time of first observation should be entered in the format year,month or year,quarter e.g.( if your data is organized in months the 1992,1 for Jan 1992 or if your data is organized in quarters then 1992,1 refers to the first quarter of 1992.\n</li>\n<li>\nfrequency: Number of observations in unit time. Example: for monthly there are 12 observation in a year.
