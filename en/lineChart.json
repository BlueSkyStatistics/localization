Click on the tab corresponding to the type of line chart you want.</br>\n            Line chart (connected by order): A line chart plots a line through points defined by the x and y coordinates and connects them in the order of variables on the x axis. When a group/color is set to a factor variable, the points are grouped by color and a separate line is generated for each group. Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable. You can also optionally specify themes, and specify a title and labels for the x and y axis​</br>\n            Stair step plot: A line chart plots a line through points defined by the x and y coordinates and creates a stair step plot, highlighting exactly when changes occur. When a color is set to a factor variable, the points are grouped by color and a separate line is generated for each color group. Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable. You can also optionally specify themes, and specify a title and labels for the x and y axis​</br>\n            Ordered by occurrence: A line chart plots a line through points defined by the x and y coordinates and connects them in the order of in which variables occur in the dataset. When a color is set to a factor variable, the points are grouped by color and a separate line is generated for each color group. Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable.
