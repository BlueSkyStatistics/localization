If a\npaired t-test, specify the difference between the paired means under the alternative hypothesis.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Power:</b> Specify the desired power of the study, i.e. the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis if the alternative hypothesis was true.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Standard Deviation:</b> Specify an estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome measure.  For paired tests, this is the standard deviation of the paired differences.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Significance Level:</b> Specify the desired significance level (i.e. type I error) of the test\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> Specify whether the test is two-sided or one-sided\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Required R Packages:</b> stats, broom\n\t\t\t"
