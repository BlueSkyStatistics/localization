This is a Cox model that allows a separate baseline hazard \n\t\t\tfunction for each strata level.  Model fitting statistics, parameter estimates, and hazard ratios are provided.  Options available include the tied time method \n\t\t\tand model diagnostics.  The model is fit using the coxph function in the survival package. \n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <b>Time to event or censor:</b> Time to event for those experiencing the event or time to last follow-up for those not experiencing the event\n            <br/><br/>\n            <b>Events (1=event, 0=censor):</b> Numerical event indicator; 1=event, 0=censor\n            <br/><br/>\n            <b>Formula Builder:</b> Construct terms to include in the model.  Factors, strings, and logical variables will be dummy coded.  The provided buttons allow you to \n\t\t\tspecify main effects, full factorial effects (main effects and all interactions with the involved variables), polynomials, specific interactions, and delete terms \n\t\t\tfrom the list.  Interactions with stratification variables is allowed.\n            <br/><br/>\n\t\t\t<b>Stratification Variables:</b> Specify one or more stratification variables.  These can be numeric, factor, ordered factor, or character variables.  The strata \n\t\t\tdivide the subjects into separate groups whereby each group has a distinct baseline hazard function.  If multiple stratification variables are given, a separate \n\t\t\tbaseline hazard function is used for every combination of stratification variable levels.\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n            <b>Weights:</b> Numeric variable for observation weights.
