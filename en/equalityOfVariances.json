But when sample sizes are small (< 20) or distributions are \nextremely skewed/heavy-tailed, the type I error rate may be inflated.</br>\nP-value for the test</br>\nIf there are 2 samples in the design, then we calculate the p-value for the multiple comparisons test using Bonett's method for a 2 variances test and a hypothesized ratio, Ρo, of 1.</br>\nIf there are k > 2 samples in the design, then let Pij be the p-value of the test for any pair (i, j ) of samples. The p-value for the multiple comparisons procedure as an overall test of equality of variances is given by the following:</br>\nP =min{Pij, 1<=i<j<=k}\n</br>\nLevene’s test statistic</br>\nLevene’s test is used to test the null hypothesis that variances are equal across groups (H₀: all variances equal) versus the alternative that at least \none variance differs. </br>\nIt is more robust to departures from normality compared to tests that assume normality (e.g., Bartlett’s). </br>\nSpecifically, we use the Brown-Forsythe modification (absolute deviations from the sample median rather than mean) for improved robustness. </br>\nInterpretation: If the p-value < α, you reject H₀ and conclude variances are not equal. </br>\n</br>\nBartlett’s test statistic</br>\nBartlett’s test is designed to test for equality of variances when the data are normally distributed. H₀: all variances equal. When k > 2 groups,\nwe use Bartlett’s test (if “use test based on normal distribution” is selected). </br>\nThe test statistic (commonly denoted B) is based on comparing the weighted arithmetic mean and the weighted geometric mean of sample variances. </br>\nThe statistic follows (approximately) a chi-square distribution with k-1 df. </br>\nBecause Bartlett’s test assumes normality, it is sensitive to departures from normality (i.e., non-normal or heavy-tailed distributions can lead to \nmisleading results)</br>\n</br>\nF-test statistic</br>\nWhen there are exactly two groups (k = 2), we use an F-test rather than Bartlett’s (if “use test based on normal distribution” is selected). </br>\nH₀: the variances are equal (σ₁² = σ₂²). </br>\nThe F-statistic is computed as the ratio of the two sample variances (larger over smaller). Then the p-value depends on the alternative hypothesis\n (one-sided “less than” or “greater than”, or two-sided). </br>\nInterpretation: If p-value < α, reject H₀ and conclude that variances differ. It is valid only under the assumption of normality.</br>\n<b>Value</b><br/>\n\n<b>Package</b></br>\nBlueSky</br>\n<b>Help</b></br>\nPlease contact support@blueskystatistics.com for additional information.\n    "
