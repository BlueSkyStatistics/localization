A skewness-kurtosis plot such as the \n\t\t\t\tone proposed by Cullen and Frey (1999) is given for the empirical distribution. On this plot, values for common \n\t\t\t\tdistributions are also displayed as a tools to help the choice of distributions to fit to data. For some \n\t\t\t\tdistributions (normal, uniform, logistic, exponential for example), there is only one possible value for the skewness \n\t\t\t\tand the kurtosis (for a normal distribution for example, skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3), and the distribution is thus \n\t\t\t\trepresented by a point on the plot. For other distributions, areas of possible values are represented, consisting in \n\t\t\t\tlines (gamma and lognormal distributions for example), or larger areas (beta distribution for example). \n\t\t\t\tThe Weibull distribution is not represented on the graph but it is indicated on the legend that shapes close to \n\t\t\t\tlognormal and gamma distributions may be obtained with this distribution.\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIn order to take into account the uncertainty of the estimated values of kurtosis and skewness from data, the data set \n\t\t\t\tmay be bootstraped by fixing the argument boot to an integer above 10. boot values of skewness and kurtosis \n\t\t\t\tcorresponding to the boot bootstrap samples are then computed and reported in blue color on the skewness-kurtosis plot.\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\tIf discrete is TRUE, the represented distributions are the Poisson, negative binomial distributions, and the normal \n\t\t\t\tdistribution to which previous discrete distributions may converge. If discrete is FALSE, these are uniform, normal, \n\t\t\t\tlogistic, lognormal, beta and gamma distributions.\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132652/how-to-determine-which-distribution-fits-my-data-best\">For a good overview of distribution fit, see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132652/how-to-determine-which-distribution-fits-my-data-best</a>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t-x-\n\t\t\t"
