Since the ratio of a normal and the root mean-square of m independent normals has a Student's t_m distribution, the square of a t_m variate has a F distribution on 1 and m degrees of freedom.\n            <br/>\n            The non-central F distribution is again the ratio of mean squares of independent normals of unit variance, but those in the numerator are allowed to have non-zero means and ncp is the sum of squares of the means. See Chisquare for further details on non-central distributions.\n            <br/>\n            <br/><b>Value</b>\n            <br/>\n            df gives the density, pf gives the distribution function qf gives the quantile function, and rf generates random deviates.\n            <br/>\n            Invalid arguments will result in return value NaN, with a warning.\n            <br/>\n            The length of the result is determined by n for rf, and is the maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions.\n            <br/>\n            The numerical arguments other than n are recycled to the length of the result. Only the first elements of the logical arguments are used.\n            <br/>\n            <br/><b>Note</b>\n            <br/>\n            Supplying ncp = 0 uses the algorithm for the non-central distribution, which is not the same algorithm used if ncp is omitted. This is to give consistent behaviour in extreme cases with values of ncp very near zero.\n            <br/>\n            The code for non-zero ncp is principally intended to be used for moderate values of ncp: it will not be highly accurate, especially in the tails, for large values.            \n"
