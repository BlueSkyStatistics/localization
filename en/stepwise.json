Either \"BIC\" (the default) or \"AIC\". Note that stepAIC labels the criterion in the output as \"AIC\" regardless of which criterion is employed.\n</li>\n<li>\n... : arguments to be passed to stepAIC.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Value</b><br/>\nThe model selected by stepAIC.<br/>\n<b>Package</b></br>\nBlueSky;MASS;RcmdrMisc</br>\n<b>Help</b></br>\nFor detailed help click on the R icon on the top right hand side of this dialog overlay or run the following command in the R syntax editor help(stepwise, package=\"RcmdrMisc\")\n"
