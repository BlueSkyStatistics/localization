In particular, they can be used in computer experiments. Most of the designs are random samples.\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\tFor the detail help - use R help(lhs.design, package = DoE.wrapper)\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\tTo try this, you may use the sample dataset file called factor_grid__latin_hypercube_Design.xlsx. Open the file in the data grid with file open menu\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"
