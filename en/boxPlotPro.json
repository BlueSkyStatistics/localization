        "body": "\n        <b>Description</b></br>\n        In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence the terms box-and-whisker plot and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points. Box and whisker plots are uniform in their use of the box: the bottom and top of the box are always the first and third quartiles, and the band inside the box is always the second quartile (the median). The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the highest value that is within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge, where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles. The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the lowest value within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers and plotted as points (as specified by Tukey).​</br>\n        Facets can be optionally created by specifying a factor variable. You can also optionally specify themes, and specify a title and labels for the x and y axis​</br>\n        When you select the option to plot the data points, we do so using geom_dotplot</br>\n        By default outliers are shown with black points, when you select the option to show outliers (In Red) via the checkbox, outliers are made more prominent.\n        <br/>\n        <b>Usage</b>\n        <br/>\n        <code> \n        ggplot(data =Dataset,aes(x = var1,y = var2,fill = var3)) + geom_boxplot()  + \n        geom_dotplot(binaxis = 'y',stackdir = 'center',dotsize = 0.1)+ coord_flip()+ labs(x = \"var1\",y = \"var2\",fill = \"var3\")   +facet_grid(var4~.)​\n        </code> <br/>\n        <b>Arguments</b><br/>\n        <ul>\n        <li>\n        data: The default dataset​\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        x: A factor/categorical variable that defines the grouping of the y variable​\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        y: A numeric  variable for which the boxplot is calculated​\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        fill: An optional factor/categorical variable to further group the existing groups.

In a notched box plot, the notches extend 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n)\n        </li>\n        </ul>\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\tif 'Add significance (p-values) mean comparison between every box pair' is selected, codes for p-values on the plot are as follows\n\t\t<br />\n\t\tns: p > 0.05\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t*: p <= 0.05\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t**: p <= 0.01\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t***: p <= 0.001\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t****: p <= 0.0001\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\tAdjustment P-value methods:\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tThe adjustment P-value methods include the Bonferroni correction (\"bonferroni\") in which the p-values are multiplied by \n\t\tthe number of comparisons. Less conservative corrections are also included by Holm (1979) (\"holm\"), Hochberg (1988) (\"hochberg\"), \n\t\tHommel (1988) (\"hommel\"), Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) (\"BH\" or its alias \"fdr\"), and Benjamini & Yekutieli (2001) (\"BY\"), \n\t\trespectively. A pass-through option (\"none\") is also included. The set of methods are contained in the p.adjust.methods vector \n\t\tfor the benefit of methods that need to have the method as an option and pass it on to p.adjust.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tThe first four methods are designed to give strong control of the family-wise error rate. There seems no reason to use the \n\t\tunmodified Bonferroni correction because it is dominated by Holm's method, which is also valid under arbitrary assumptions.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tHochberg's and Hommel's methods are valid when the hypothesis tests are independent or when they are non-negatively associated \n\t\t(Sarkar, 1998; Sarkar and Chang, 1997). Hommel's method is more powerful than Hochberg's, but the difference is usually small \n\t\tand the Hochberg p-values are faster to compute.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tThe \"BH\" (aka \"fdr\") and \"BY\" methods of Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli control the false discovery rate, the expected \n\t\tproportion of false discoveries amongst the rejected hypotheses. The false discovery rate is a less stringent condition than \n\t\tthe family-wise error rate, so these methods are more powerful than the others.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tSee also \n\t\t<br/>\n\t\thelp(geom_pwc, package=ggpubr)\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\thelp(ggadjust_pvalue, package=ggpubr)\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n        <b>Package</b></br>\n        ggplot2;ggthemes;stringr</br>\n        <b>Help</b></br>\n        help(geom_boxplot, package=ggplot2)</br>\n        Click the R Help button to get detailed R help.
