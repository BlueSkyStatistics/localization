Note that sorting creates a second copy of the set of associations which can be slow and memory consuming for large sets. With order = TRUE a integer vector with the order is returned instead of the reordered associations.\n            If only the top n associations are needed then head using by performs this faster than calling sort and then head since it does it without copying and rearranging all the data. tail works in the same way.\n            <br/><br/>  \n            <b> \n            Value\n            </b> \n            <br/>\n            An object of the same class as x.                  \n    "
