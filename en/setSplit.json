For example if you run a crosstabulation analysis or a hypothesis test, this analysis is performed independently for each split (the output of the analysis is also generated separately for each split). \n         <br/>\n                <b>Usage</b>\n                <br/>\n                     <code> \n        BSkySetDataFrameSplit(col.names, datasetnameorindex, removeall.splits = FALSE)\n          </code> <br/>\n            <b>Arguments</b><br/>\n                 <ul>\n                   <li>\n        col.names: These are the column names/variable names that you want to split the dataset by, e.g. col.names =c(\"var1\", \"var2\").\n         </li>\n                <li>\n        datasetnameorindex: this is the name of the index.â€‹\n          </li>\n                <li>\n        removeall.splits: TRUE splits are removed, FALSE splits are added.\n         </li>\n                </ul>\n            <b>Package</b></br>\n               Not applicable, this function is an internal function in the BlueSky package.
